			</h1>

			

<p>
				☛ Roronoa Zoro,[20] also known as <strong>"Pirate Hunter"</strong> Zoro, is the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates,
				 one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,and is publicly recognized 
				 as the right-hand man of his crew's captain <b>Monkey D. Luffy</b> . Formerly a <b>bounty hunter</b>,he is the second member 
				 of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc<br><br>


				☛ Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, 
				the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru,
				 making him a matrilineal descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, 
				 Shimotsuki Ryuma. As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created
				  during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is among the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, 
				  alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to become the greatest
				   swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.<br><br>
				☛ In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, Zoro, alongside his captain 
				are included among the ranks of the <b>"Worst Generation"</b>, pirates who simultaneously reached the Sabaody Archipelago 
				with bounties of over Beli <b>100,000,000</b> shortly before the Summit War, as well as Marshall D. Teach.<br><br>
				☛ He gained his first bounty of Beli <b>60,000,000</b> after the Arabasta Arc. 
				It later increased to Beli <b>120,000,000</b> after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to Beli <b>320,000,000</b> after
				 the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli <b>1,111,000,000</b>.
